[h1]Description[/h1]

The ability to place the evac zone has been modified. No longer will you be able to place the evac zone wherever you want. No longer will it appear immediately either.
You will now request an evac, then Firebrand will place the evac zone when she is ready.

[h1]Changes[/h1]

By default, requesting an evac will break concealment. Firebrand will need at least 2 turns to find a location. A flare will show where the evac zone will spawn.
The evac zone will remain active for 3 turns.

All can be changed in the config folder in [u]XComRequestEvac.ini[/u]

[h1]Notes[/h1]

Do not use this mod if you're using the Tutorial. You won't be able to place the evac because it is modifying the Place Evac ability.
